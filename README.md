# 🔐 Network Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset. It was developed as part of the IBM-SB4Academia Capstone Project 2025.

## 📊 Algorithms Used
- Random Forest (98.6% accuracy)
- SVM
- Logistic Regression

## 🧪 Dataset
- [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, IBM Cloud Lite (for deployment)

## 🖼 Sample Outputs

## 📈 Results

| Model              | Accuracy  |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Random Forest      | 98.6%     |
| SVM                | 93.4%     |
| Logistic Regression| 90.2%     |

✅ Random Forest was the most effective in detecting all intrusion types.
